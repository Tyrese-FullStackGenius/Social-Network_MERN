# MERN Social Network
Work in progress. 

**Goal:** Build a MERN stack social network app. 

**High priority:**
* As a user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can log in.
* As a user, I want to be able to log in so that I can view my home feed.
* As a user, I want to be able to view posts so that I know what my friends are up to.
* As a user, I want to be able to create a post so that I can share my current status.
* As a user, I want to be able to delete my posts so that people can no longer see them.
* As a user, I want to be able to edit my posts so that I can correct or clarify my thoughts.

**Medium priority:**
* As a user, I want to be able to like/unlike a post so that I can approve of posts I am fond of.
* As a user, I want to be able to reply to a post so that I can share additional thoughts.
* As a user, I want to be able to view other peopleâ€™s profiles so that I can learn more about them.
* As a user, I want to be able to edit my own profile so that I can add more style to my bio.

**Low priority:**
* As a user, I want to be able to search for and friend other users on the network so that I can build connections.
* As a user, I want to be able to instantly message my friends so that we can have real-time conversations with each other.
